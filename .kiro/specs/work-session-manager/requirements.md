# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Work Session Manager is a VS Code extension designed to help developers manage their working time effectively by implementing the Pomodoro Technique or similar time management methodologies. The extension tracks work sessions and rest periods, providing visual feedback through the status bar and optional audio notifications. Users can customize session durations, rest periods, visual appearance, and control the timer with play/pause functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure custom work session and rest period durations, so that I can adapt the time management system to my personal productivity preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens VS Code settings THEN the extension SHALL provide configuration options for session duration (in minutes)
2. WHEN the user opens VS Code settings THEN the extension SHALL provide configuration options for rest duration (in minutes)
3. WHEN the user sets a session duration THEN the system SHALL accept values between 1 and 120 minutes
4. WHEN the user sets a rest duration THEN the system SHALL accept values between 1 and 60 minutes
5. IF no custom durations are set THEN the system SHALL default to 25 minutes for sessions and 5 minutes for rest

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a countdown timer in the VS Code status bar, so that I can monitor my current session or rest period without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a work session is active THEN the status bar SHALL display a countdown showing remaining session time
2. WHEN a rest period is active THEN the status bar SHALL display a countdown showing remaining rest time
3. WHEN the countdown reaches zero THEN the system SHALL automatically transition to the next phase (session to rest or rest to session)
4. WHEN displaying time THEN the system SHALL use MM:SS format for clarity
5. WHEN no timer is running THEN the status bar SHALL show a neutral state indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want play/pause controls for the timer, so that I can manage interruptions and control my work sessions flexibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is running THEN the status bar SHALL display a pause button
2. WHEN the timer is paused THEN the status bar SHALL display a play button
3. WHEN the user clicks the pause button THEN the system SHALL pause the current countdown
4. WHEN the user clicks the play button THEN the system SHALL resume the countdown from where it was paused
5. WHEN the timer is paused THEN the status bar SHALL visually indicate the paused state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the visual appearance of the timer display, so that it integrates well with my VS Code theme and personal preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide color customization options for work session display
2. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide color customization options for rest period display
3. WHEN a work session is active THEN the status bar SHALL use the configured work session color
4. WHEN a rest period is active THEN the status bar SHALL use the configured rest period color
5. IF no custom colors are set THEN the system SHALL use default colors (green for work, red for rest)
6. WHEN the user configures colors THEN the system SHALL accept valid hex color codes or color names

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optional audio notifications for session transitions, so that I can be alerted to take breaks or resume work even when focused on my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide an option to enable/disable sound notifications
2. WHEN a work session ends AND sound is enabled THEN the system SHALL play a notification sound
3. WHEN a rest period ends AND sound is enabled THEN the system SHALL play a notification sound
4. WHEN sound notifications are disabled THEN the system SHALL provide only visual feedback
5. WHEN playing notification sounds THEN the system SHALL use system-appropriate audio that works across platforms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control the visibility of timer elements, so that I can customize my status bar according to my preferences and screen space constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to show/hide the countdown display
2. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to show/hide the status indicator dot
3. WHEN countdown display is hidden THEN the status bar SHALL show only the status dot and controls
4. WHEN status dot is hidden THEN the status bar SHALL show only the countdown and controls
5. WHEN both elements are enabled THEN the status bar SHALL display the complete interface

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using different operating systems and VS Code variants, I want the extension to work consistently across all platforms, so that I can maintain my productivity workflow regardless of my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed on Windows THEN all features SHALL function correctly
2. WHEN the extension is installed on macOS THEN all features SHALL function correctly
3. WHEN the extension is installed on Linux THEN all features SHALL function correctly
4. WHEN the extension is used in VS Code forks (like VSCodium) THEN all features SHALL maintain compatibility
5. WHEN audio notifications are enabled THEN sounds SHALL play correctly on all supported platforms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to persist my timer state across VS Code sessions, so that I don't lose my progress when restarting the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code is closed during an active session THEN the system SHALL save the current timer state
2. WHEN VS Code is reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the previous timer state if it was active
3. WHEN the saved session has expired during closure THEN the system SHALL transition to the appropriate next phase
4. WHEN no previous session exists THEN the system SHALL start in a neutral state
5. WHEN timer state is restored THEN the user SHALL be notified of the current phase and remaining time
